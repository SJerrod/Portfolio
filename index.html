      <h2 class="bg-warning"><strong>About me</strong></h2>
        <p><em>I grew up in <span class="sunshine">Florida</span>, while attending Bayshore highschool I focused my education on physics. When the opportunity presented itself to go forth and see the states I took it. After Highschool I went on to attend <span class="blue">The Citadel</span>, military college of Souch Carolina majoring in physics. While having no prior experience in coding, I have always had an intrest in making games. With some research and through meeting previous alumni from <span class="green">Epicodus</span> it seemed clear that it was the right choice to sign up. In the past I have been a server, taking orders in the restaurant. In the future Id hope to be writing orders for a server with a tech company.</em></p>
