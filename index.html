  <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I grew up in florida, in highschool focusing my education on physics and when the opportunity presented itself to go forth and see the states I took it. After Highschool I went on to attend The Citadel, military college of Souch Carolina majoring in physics. While having no prior experience in coding, I have always had an intrest in making games. With some research and through meeting previous alumni from Epicodus it seemed clear that it was the right choice to sign up. In the past I have been a server, taking orders in the restaurant. In the future Id hope to be writing orders for a server with a tech company.</p>
